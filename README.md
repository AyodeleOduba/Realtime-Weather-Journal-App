Project: Realtime Weather Journal App 

Project Objective: Build an asynchronous web app that uses Web API from OpenWeatherMap and user data to dynamically update the UI in a Weather Journal application.  

Methodology: The weather journal was built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The project environment uses Express, Body-Parser, and Cors. The user inputs their zip code and feeling into the UI. The input data is used to retrieve the current temperature from the API. The date, temperature and user's feeling are posted to the server and the UI gets and displays the date, temperature and user's feeling data from the server.
